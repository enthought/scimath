SciMath CHANGELOG
=================

Release 5.0.0
-------------

This is a major release that is focused around code clean-up and modernization.

Much of the work was around removing deprecated and broken components, while
updating code to remove usage of deprecated things from Python and ETS.  In
particular, this release drops support for Python versions 3.5 and earlier.

Additionally, the scimath.units.plugin sub-package has been removed: it was
broken and removing it permitted a simplification of dependencies: we don't
require Envisage and its dependencies in this release.

Release 4.2.0
-------------

Released : 06 February 2019

This minor release accumulates a large number of improvements, changes and
bug fixes to the scimath codebase.

A few highlights of this release are :

* Support for Python 3

* Enhancements to time units and the addition new units.

* Support for newer versions of Numpy


Change summary since 4.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change: Setup Travis and Appveyor CI (#71)

* Change: Use PEP 440 compliant development version (#69)

* Fix : Restore parsing of angular minutes and seconds (#66)

* Feature : Enhancement of time units (#65)

* Fix : Missing imports (#63)

* Fix : Support newer versions of Numpy (#62)

* Feature: Port to Python 3 (#50)

* Converted the most-used traits to authentic TraitTypes. (#57)

* Added __str__ methods on UnitScalar and UnitArray classes, to make it easier
  to see values with their unit (label) (#46).

* Fix: Adding unit test for extending unit parser (#43)

* Fix: Parser extend method throws a NameError when custom units are added to the parser. (#41)

* Feature: added inHg unit for inches of mercury (#40)

* Feature: added dimensionless "fract" unit (#38)

* Feature: added units barn, rayl, barns_per_electron, US survey foot (#33)

* Fix: `'None'` was parsed into an invalid unit with `None` as its `value`. (#31)

* Fix: UnitArray comparisons will return boolean arrays, like their unadorned
  ndarray counterpart. (#29)

* Fix: raising a unitless `UnitArray` raised to a power. Thanks to @rupertnash
  for reporting and fixing the bug. (#5, #28)

* Fix: Remove trivial (0.0) offsets from the string representation of units. (#27)

* Fix: numpy change in how vectorize() keeps the original function. (#26)

* Feature: Enhance the unit parser to parse all of the provided units, with or without
  offsets. (#25)

* Fix: Correct the definition of PPG to be a density unit instead of a pressure
  gradient unit. Calculations using PPG as a pressure gradient unit can be
  recovered simply by multiplying the PPG quantity by g, the acceleration due
  to gravity. To precisely recover the exact values from the previous
  definition, use ``0.0519 * psi_per_f / ppg`` for this value, which is not
  necessarily the best estimate for g. (#24)

* Fix: Update to modern numpy C API to eliminate deprecation warnings (#22)

* Fix: PEP whitespace cleanups (#20)

* Fix: Address string literal deprecation warnings in _interpolate build, removing
  warnings during compilation (#19)
